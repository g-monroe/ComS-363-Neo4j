The graph platform takes a connections-first approach to data. It broadens a company’s ability recognize the importance of persisting relationships and connections through every transition of existence: from idea, to design in a logical model, to implementation in a physical model, to operation using a query language and to persistence within a scalable, reliable database system. The foundation of representing connected data is known as a graph.
